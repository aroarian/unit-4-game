# Crystal Game

At the start of the game:
     A random "Number" will be selected between 19-120.

     Each crystal will be assigned a random value between 1-12.


Click the crystals to add to your "Total" to try to match the random "Number".

If you go over the "Number" you lose!

When you win/lose your "Total" will be set to 0 and a new "Number" will be selected.
